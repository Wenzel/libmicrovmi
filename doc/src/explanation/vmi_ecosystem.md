# VMI Fragmentation

_Virtual Machine Introspection_ has been around since [2003](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2003/virtual-machine-introspection-based-architecture-intrusion-detection/),
yet the ecosystem is still heavily fragmented and lacks standards as well as interoperability.

See our talk at FOSDEM 2020: [Rustifying the Virtual Machine Introspection ecosystem](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/rust_vm_introspection/).
